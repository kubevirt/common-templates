# Template development guidelines

The idea is to reuse and enhance the concept of OpenShift templates and its parameter expansion and also to reuse the kubevirtâ€™s VM.spec structure as a DTO that will provide data to the parameter expansion.

Since the templates will contain lots of redundancies, there should be a build time templating mechanism for composing the final templates from snippets.

Also, there might be multiple different OSes, flavors, sizes mentioned by any single template file if they share the same configuration.

Please note that the cnv.io suffix used in labels and annotations is temporary and is likely to change.

## User Experience

The flow should be the same as usual with regards to openshift templates. The user either takes a local template and generates a VM object.

Or the user gets a template from kubernetes and invokes the proper REST command on top of it to keep the VM linked to the template or edit it in accordance to the template.

The UI can then operate on top of template parameters and/or the Template.VM.spec DOM directly. There is an openshift [REST endpoint for instantiating Templates](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/rest_api/examples.html#template-instantiation) and the UI might be able to use it to create an in memory instance of VM it will then work with before posting it (kubernetes dry-run issues [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/11488](#11488) and [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/63559](#63559)).

### VM.yaml

The above template should result in the following VM object:

```YAML
# vim: sts=2 sw=2 et
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: windows-10-1
  annotations:
    # Data used for the UI, ignored by kubevirt
    # Arbitrary format as needed to be able to
    # repopulate the UI or the template processor
    # and get the same output
    parameters.template.cnv.io/MEMORY_SIZE: 8

    # Extension for specifying which elements were customized.
    # The idea is to record fields that need to be preserved
    # during spec replacement happening as part of Template
    # editing or upgrade.
    # The content is a line separated list of jsonpath selectors.
    # The jsonpath root is the spec: element of the VM object
    template.cnv.io/keep: |
      /template.spec.domain.cpu.cores
      /template.spec.domain.resources.requests.memory
      /template.spec.domain.devices.disks
      /template.spec.volumes
      /template.spec.networks

  labels:
    # This labels will link the VM to a template that was
    # used to create it. This can be then used by the user
    # or UI for recomputing the VM.spec using updated
    # template. A VM without this label can be considered
    # "baked" and not linked to any template.
    vm.cnv.io/template: windows

    # This optional label will link the VM to a template
    # namespace that was used to create it.
    # If this label is not defined, the template is 
    # expected to belong to the same namespace as the VM.
    vm.cnv.io/template-namespace: openshift

# The requested state of the VM that will always match what
# the user asked for exactly. When the UI pushes edits it
# simply replaces the whole spec: with the current version
# the user saved
spec:
  running: false
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        resources:
          initial:
            memory: 8Mi
        devices:
          disks:
          - name: default-disk
            disk:
              dev: vda
            volumeName: default-volume

          interfaces:
          - type: pod-network
            name: default-network
            model:
              type: virtio

      volumes:
      - name: default-volume
        registryDisk:
          image: test/image

status:
  devices:
    # Roman's idea I like:
    # This block should contain the backpropagated
    # addresses needed for keeping the device ordering stable.
    # The user defined addresses in VM.spec have higher priority.
    # The values here should be used during the VM -> VMI conversion
    # or later (VMI -> domxml) and the VM.spec should only contain
    # the values user requested as is.
    disk0:
      scsi-id: X.Y.Z
    disk1:
      scsi-id: X.Y.Z
    nic0:
      pci-id: X.Y.Z
    nic0:
      mac-address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

## Future enhancements

- Parameter replacement could support numerical expressions (either in the template or during parameter definition - one parameter building on top of another)

## Open questions

- How and when should we propagate Template changes to already created VMs. I assume a new controller will be created to watch for changes and inform / apply them as needed.
